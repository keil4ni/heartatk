# Heart Attack Data Analysis
hello! this project was created during my time at a 3 week AI Camp summer session with 5 other team members + my instructor (all members are
mentioned on the website).
<br><br>
to make this project happen: we used a Kaggle dataset to help create data visualizations and fine-tune various machine learning models to predict the chances
of an individual experiencing a heart attack in the future. afterward, we compared each model to see which scored the highest accuracy. please feel free to check
out our [website](https://keil4ni.github.io/heartatk/) and reach out if you have any questions or concerns! thank you!
