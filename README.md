# Heart Attack Predictor
hello! this project was created during my time at a 3 week AI Camp summer session with 5 other team members + my instructor (all members are
mentioned on the website).
<br><br>
to make this project happen: we used a Kaggle dataset to help create data visualizations and various machine learning models that predict the chances
of an individual experiencing a heart attack in the future. please feel free to check out our website and reach out if you have any questions or concerns!
